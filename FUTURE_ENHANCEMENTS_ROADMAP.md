# Zapp Interaction Net System - Future Enhancements Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the current limitations of the Zapp Interaction Net System and provides a detailed roadmap for addressing them in future development sessions. The current system has achieved 100% test success rate for basic functionality, but there are several advanced features that need implementation to support more complex lambda calculus expressions and recursive functions.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Nested Lambda Applications ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING

**Current Status**: Basic nested lambda applications work but produce incorrect results
**Example**: `(λx.λy.x + y) 2 3` → Currently evaluates to `3` instead of `5`

**Root Cause**: The system only handles single lambda applications correctly. Nested applications require multiple reduction steps and proper variable substitution across multiple levels.

**Technical Issues**:
- Multi-step reduction pipeline not fully implemented
- Variable substitution doesn't handle nested scopes correctly
- Argument passing to inner lambda functions is incomplete

### 2. Complex Recursive Functions ❌ NOT WORKING

**Current Status**: Recursive functions like factorial cannot be evaluated
**Example**: `def factorial n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)`

**Root Cause**: Missing fundamental language features required for recursion

**Technical Issues**:
- No conditional logic (if/then/else) support
- No comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- No proper recursion handling in interaction nets
- No base case and recursive case differentiation

### 3. Advanced Lambda Calculus Features ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Missing Features**:
- Higher-order functions (functions as arguments)
- Closures and lexical scoping
- Partial function application
- Function composition
- Y-combinator for recursion

### 4. Type System Limitations ⚠️ BASIC ONLY

**Current Status**: Only basic type checking exists
**Missing Features**:
- Type inference
- Generic types
- Function types
- Type safety in reductions

## Detailed Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Nested Lambda Applications (Priority: HIGH)

#### 1.1 Multi-Step Reduction Pipeline
**Objective**: Enable proper evaluation of nested lambda applications

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Enhance Reduction Engine**
   - Modify [`reduceToNormalForm()`](src/core/interaction_net.js:388) to handle multiple reduction cycles
   - Implement proper reduction scheduling for nested applications
   - Add reduction step tracking and optimization

2. **Fix Variable Substitution**
   - Enhance [`reduceLambdaApp()`](src/core/interaction_net.js:273) to handle nested scopes
   - Implement proper environment tracking for variable bindings
   - Add support for shadowing and scope resolution

3. **Multi-Argument Application**
   - Extend [`parseLambdaApplication()`](src/core/net_parser.js:410) to handle multiple arguments
   - Implement currying support for multi-parameter functions
   - Add proper argument passing mechanism

**Expected Outcome**: `(λx.λy.x + y) 2 3` → `5`

#### 1.2 Test Cases to Implement
```javascript
// Basic nested application
(λx.λy.x + y) 2 3 → 5

// Function composition
(λf.λx.f (f x)) (λy.y + 1) 3 → 5

// Higher-order functions
(λf.λx.f x) (λy.y * 2) 5 → 10
```

### Phase 2: Implement Conditional Logic (Priority: HIGH)

#### 2.1 Add Comparison Operations
**Objective**: Support boolean comparisons for conditional logic

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **New Agent Types**
   - Add `BOOL` agent type for boolean values

3. **Parser Extensions**
   - Update [`tokenizeZapp()`](src/core/net_parser.js:785) to recognize comparison operators
   - Modify [`parseExpressionWithPrecedence()`](src/core/net_parser.js:158) to handle comparisons
   - Add precedence levels for comparisons

**Expected Outcome**: `2 == 3` → `false`, `2 < 3` → `true`

#### 2.2 Implement If-Then-Else Logic
**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Conditional Reduction**
   - Implement `reduceIfThenElse()` for conditional evaluation
   - Add proper branching logic in interaction nets
   - Handle lazy evaluation of branches

2. **Parser Support**
   - Add if-then-else parsing to [`parseTokens()`](src/core/net_parser.js:31)
   - Implement proper AST generation for conditionals

**Expected Outcome**: `if 2 < 3 then 5 else 10` → `5`

### Phase 3: Enable Recursive Functions (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 3.1 Self-Reference Support
**Objective**: Allow functions to reference themselves

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Recursive Agent Creation**

   - Add recursion detection and infinite recursion prevention
